# People of MAGA

Let's remember all the main characters of the series.

# Trump family

||profile-grid
donald-trump.jpg | Donald Trump | 1946-06-14 | US President | What does one even say about Trump himself at this point?
melania-trump.jpg | Melania Trump | 1970-04-26 | First Lady | N&#0233;e Knavs, married Donald in 2005. - Was probably just a model who didn't know what she was in for at first, but has stuck by Trump through all this, so she can rot in hell with him now.
donald-trump-jr.jpg | Donald Trump Jr | 1977-12-31 | Son, executive in Trump Organization | Involved in running the Trump Organization, going around trying to make deals to profit from his father's fame and presidency. - Is also involved in World Liberty Financial, again a company just designed to profit from Trump's presidency.
eric-trump.jpg | Eric Trump | 1984-01-06 | Son, executive in Trump Organization | Same as Don Jr, basically. - His wife is Lara Trump, who's now a Fox News host.
ivanka-trump.jpg | Ivanka Trump | 1981-10-30 | Daughter, Fmr. Presidential Advisor | Involved in government, campaigning, media relations for her father. - Ran a jewellery, fashion company, lifestyle brand. - Hasn't been in the spotlight as much for Trump's second term.
tiffany-trump.jpg | Tiffany Trump | 1993-10-13 | Daughter | Appears at some events and posts on social media in support of her father. Aside from that she doesn't do much.
baron-trump.jpg | Baron Trump | 2006-03-20 | Son | Trump thinks he's a computer genius because he knows how to turn on a laptop.
lara-trump.jpg | Lara Trump | 1982-10-12 | Daughter-in-Law | N&#0233;e Yunaska, married Eric Trump in 2014. - Has a show on Fox News (contributor 2021--22, now starring in *My View with Lara Trump* which debuted in 2025).
jared-kushner.jpg | Jared Kushner | 1981-01-10 | Son-in-law, Fmr. Presidential Advisor | Married Ivanka Trump in 2009. - Involved in first Trump admin's Middle Eastern policy, and receiving huge amounts of money from Saudi Arabia (see his company, [Affinity Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_Partners)). - Hasn't been in the spotlight as much for Trump's second term.

There's also grandchildren who are even younger. Note that Trump has a relative named Mary Trump, his niece (the daughter of Trump's brother, who died in the 80s), who despises the family and wrote a book about what a dysfunctional bunch of fucks this whole family is. From what I can tell Trump's current wife, Melania, doesn't really do anything.

# Trump's government

I will write this once, instead of repeating it each time. These people all support Trump dismantling American democracy and rule of law. They are voluntarily playing a part in the slide toward authoritarianism America is currently experiencing. They all supported him even after he tried to organize a coup d'&#0233;tat in 2021. They all shamelessly repeat any lies they're told to in order to justify the goals of the regime. Though they're all terrible in different ways, there is not one decent person here.

jd-vance.jpg | JD Vance | 1984-08-02 | Vice President | Very ideologically driven, willing to make sacrifices for power. - Has probably engaged in blood rituals with Peter Thiel and other techno-fascist billionaires. - Notably once said Trump is either a cynical asshole or America's Hitler, but now doesn't care. - Has an [Indian wife,](media/002.jpg) oddly.
pam-bondi.jpg | Pam Bondi | 1965-11-17 | Attorney General (Department of Justice) | Trump's lawyer during his impeachment proceedings. - As AG, her job is to help legitimize Trump's crimes. He tells her he wants to do, and she lies and twists to try and make it sound legal. - Mob lawyer material.
pete-hegseth.jpg | Pete Hegseth | 1980-06-06 | Secretary of Defense | Given this key cabinet position despite being totally unqualified because he's a Trump loyalist and Trump saw him on TV. - Formerly a Fox News host (*Fox & Friends*, 2017--24). - Note his [neo-Nazi tatoos.](media/001.jpg)
scott-bessent.jpg | Scott Bessent | 1962-08-21 | Secretary of Treasury | Billionaire hedge fund executive who randomly became part of the government. - Was a Democrat who supported Obama and Hillary before 2016. By 2024, he was fundaraising huge amounts for Trump. - He [didn't get along with Elon Musk.](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/musk-bessent-trump-white-house-irs) He's also gay.
rfk-jr.jpg | Robert F. Kennedy Jr. | 1954-01-17 | Secretary of Health and Human Services | A lawyer; knows nothing about medicine or science. - Secretly a demon who wants as many people to die from preventable diseases as possible. - The very opposite of who you should want leading the HHS.

stephen-miller.jpg | Stephen Miller | 1984-08-23 | White House Deputy Chief of Staff | Trump loyalist from Trump's first term, where he was an advisor. - Influential despite not having a prestigious office. He wrote Trump's speechs, executive orders. - He's basically a neo-Nazi, down to the look: he's a far-right, white supremacist, wants dictatorship, wants to purge immigrants from the country. A true-believer Trump lunatic.

tulsi-gabbard.jpg | Tulsi Gabbard | 1981-04-12 | Director of National Intelligence | Fmr. Democratic Rep from Hawaii; switched to Republican in 2022 (to no one's surprise). - Incompetent traitor who never should've been trusted with anything. It's tragically ironic that for her to be DNI.
kash-patel.jpg | Kash Patel | 1980-02-25 | FBI Director | Totally bought-in Trump-cultist to a frightening degree.

howard-lutnick.jpg | Howard Lutnick | 1961-07-14 | Secretary of Commerce | Vocal advocate of tariffs and trade wars, always says the money is about to start pouring in, just wait another week. - He's always available for interviews, but listening to him is always a waste of time because it's always just vacuous propaganda.

Major figure orchistrating the Jan-6 coup plot. - He was on the line with Trump during [the infamous "find the votes" Georgia phone call.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call) - Imprisoned in 2024 until Trump pardoned him so he could resume his White House job. - In one of his bullshit books, he sources "Ron Vara", an anagram of his own name because he couldn't get any real economists to sign off on his bullshit.
